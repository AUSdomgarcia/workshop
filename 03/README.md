# 03. Combining Redux and React Router State

- Use React Router's `<Link>` component instead of our custom `<Link>`.
- Use `params` props inside `mapPropsToState` to get current filter.
- Remove the `visibilityFilter` reducer and corresponding actions.
- Update `getVisibleTodos` constants to match router params.
